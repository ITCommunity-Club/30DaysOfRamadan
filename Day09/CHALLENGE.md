##### ” اللَّهُ لاَ إِلَهَ إِلاَّ هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ لاَ تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلاَ نَوْمٌ لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِنْدَهُ إِلاَّ بِإِذْنِهِ يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلاَ يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلاَّ بِمَا شَاءَ وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاواتِ وَالأَرْضَ وَلاَ يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ
##### “ Allah! There is no god but He - the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor Sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there that can intercede in His presence except as he permitteth? He knoweth what (appeareth to His creatures As) Before or After or Behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge except as He willeth. His throne doth extend over the heavens and on earth, and He feeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them, For He is the Most High, the Supreme (in glory).

## Todays challenge description [ Another XOR ] :

You are given integers N,M,K and N integers A1​,A2​,…,AN​.

You can perform the following operation at most K times:

    Choose any integer x such that 0≤x< 2^M Then, for each 1≤i≤N1, you can replace Ai​ with Ai​⊕x, or leave it unchanged.

What is the maximum value of A1+A2+…+AN that you can achieve after this process?

### Input Format

    The first line of the input contains a single integer T − the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

    The first line of each test case contains three integers N,M,K.

The second line of each test case contains N integers A1,A2,…,AN.

### Output Format

For each test case, output the maximum value of A1​+A2​+…+AN​ that you can achieve.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤10
            1≤N≤120
            1≤M≤120
            1≤K≤5
            0≤Ai​<2^M.

Sample 1:

| Input        | Output |
| ------------ | ------ |
| 2            | 55     |
| 4 4 2        | 620    |
| 0 4 2 12     |        |
| 5 7 3        |        |
| 2 28 14 88 1 |        |

### Explanation:

In the first test case, one of the possible sequences of operations is the following:

- **First operation:** Choose x=12, and XOR A1​,A2​ and A3 with it, obtaining array [12,8,14,12].

- **Second operation:** Choose x=3, and XOR A1,A2 and A4​ with it, obtaining array [15,11,14,15], with sum 55.

### ADVICE 💖

Google and ChatGPT can be your so called "best friends" but it won't get you anywhere <3 Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are for the weakest of us all ;)
