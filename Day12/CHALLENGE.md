## Todays challenge description [ king travel 👑 ] :

King loves to go on tours with his friends.

King has **N** cars that can seat **5** people each and **M** cars that can seat **7** people each. Determine the maximum number of people that can travel together in these cars.
### Input Format

    The first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and M — the number of 5-seaters and 7-seaters, respectively.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the maximum number of people that can travel together.
Constraints

            1≤T≤100
            0≤N,M≤1000 

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 4 |76|
|4 8|101|
|2 13|105|
|14 5|96|
|8 8  | |

### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: King has 4 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So,  4×5+8×7=76people can travel together.

 - **Test case 2**: King has 2 cars that seat 5 each and 13 cars that seat 7 each. So, 2×5+13×7=101 people can travel together.

 - **Test case 3**: King has 14 cars that seat 5 each and 5 cars that seat 7 each. So,14×5+7×7=105 people can travel together.

 - **Test case 4**: King has 8 cars that seat 5 each and 8 cars that seat 7 each. So, 8×5+8×7=96 people can travel together.
