## Todays challenge description [ Sharing is caring ] :

Amina and Belkiss are very good friends and they always distribute all the eatables equally among themselves.

Amina has A chocolates and Belkiss has B chocolates. Determine whether Amina and Belkiss can distribute all the chocolates equally among themselves.

Note that:

    It is not allowed to break a chocolate into more than one piece.
    No chocolate shall be left in the distribution.

### Input Format

    The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers AAA and BBB, the number of chocolates that Amina and Belkiss have, respectively.

### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line YES if Amina and Belkiss can distribute all the chocolates equally, else output NO.
The output is case insensitive, i.e, yes, YeS, yES will all be accepted as correct answers when Amina and Belkiss can distribute the chocolates equally.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤1000
            1≤A,B≤10000



Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 4     | YES    |
| 1 1   | YES    |
| 1 3   | NO     |
| 1 2   | NO     |
| 1 4   |        |

### Explanation:

- **Test case 1**: Both Amina and Belkiss already have equal number of chocolates, hence it is possible to distribute the chocolates equally among Amina and Belkiss.

- **Test case 2**: : If Belkiss gives one of his chocolates to Amina, then both of them will have equal number of chocolates, i.e. 2. So, it is possible to distribute the chocolates equally among Amina and Belkiss.

- **Test case 3**: There are total 3 chocolates. These chocolates cannot be divided equally among Amina and Belkiss.

- **Test case 4**: Amina and Belkiss cannot have equal number of chocolates, no matter how they distribute the chocolates.
