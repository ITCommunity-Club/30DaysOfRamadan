## Todays challenge description [ EgyBest pro Pro ] :


Ayoub, Mohamed, and Chahine are contributing to buy a EgyBest pro subscription. However, EgyBest pro allows only two users to share a subscription.

Given that Ayoub, Mohamed, and Chahine have A,B and C Dinars respectively and a EgyBest pro subscription costs X Dinars, find whether any two of them can contribute to buy a subscription.

### Input Format

   
    The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
    Each test case contains four space-separated integers A,B,C, and X — the amount that Ayoub, Mohamed, and Chahine have, and the cost of a EgyBest pro subscription respectively.




### Output Format

For each test case, output YES, if any two of Ayoub, Mohamed, and Chahine can contribute to buy an EgyBest pro subscription or NO otherwise.

You may print each character in uppercase or lowercase. For example, NO, no, No, and nO are all considered identical.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤1000
            1≤A,B,C,X≤100

           

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 4 |NO|
|1 1 1 3|YES|
|2 3 1 5|YES|
|4 2 3 4|NO|
|2 1 4 7| |



### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: No two people can contribute to collect enough money to buy a EgyBest pro subscription.

 - **Test case 2**: Ayoub and Mohamed can contribute and collect a total of 5 Dinars which is enough to buy an EgyBest pro subscription of 5 Dinars.

 - **Test case 3**: One possible way is, Mohamed and Chahine can contribute and collect a total of 5 Dinars which is enough to buy a EgyBest pro subscription of 4 Dinars.
     Note that there are other possible ways as well
 
 - **Test case 4**: No two people can contribute to collect enough money to buy an EgyBest pro subscription.
