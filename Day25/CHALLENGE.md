##### ”رَبَّنَا وَآتِنَا مَا وَعَدتَّنَا عَلَى رُسُلِكَ وَلاَ تُخْزِنَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّكَ لاَ تُخْلِفُ الْمِيعَاد

##### “Our Lord! Grant us what Thou didst promise unto us through Thine apostles, and save us from shame on the Day of Judgment: For Thou never breakest Thy promise [3:194]

## Todays challenge description [ PBDS - codeforces ] :

You are given an array a of n integers. 

Find the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n) where the sum of ai+aj is greater than or equal to l and less than or equal to r (that is, l≤ai+aj≤r).

### example:

if n=3, a=[5,1,2], l=4 and r=7, then two pairs are suitable:

    i=1 and j=2 (4≤5+1≤7);
    i=1 and j=3 (4≤5+2≤7).

### NOTE:  
    Policy based data structures in g++
    Difficulty Level : Medium

    The g++ compiler also supports some data structures that are not part of the C++ standard library. Such structures are called policy-based data structures. These data structures are designed for high-performance, flexibility, semantic safety, and conformance to the corresponding containers in std.
    To use these structures, the following lines must be added to the code:

    #include <ext/pb_ds/assoc_container.hpp>
    using namespace __gnu_pbds;

### ADVICE 💖

Google and ChatGPT can be your so called "best friends" but it won't get you anywhere <3 Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are for the weakest of us all ;)
