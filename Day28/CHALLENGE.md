##### ” أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لاَ شَرِيكَ لَهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ، اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْنِي مِنَ التَّوَّابِينَ وَاجْعَلْنِي مِنَ الْمُتَطَهِّرِينَ

##### “ I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, alone without partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. O Allah, make me of those who return to You often in repentance and make me of those who remain clean and pure.

## Todays challenge description [ Page Rank Algorithm ] :

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are N sites, and each site i has a certain count Ci of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site Sj is defined as :

                        score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz)) 

Here, Sx, Sy, ..., Sz denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to Sj, and d is a damping factor, usually set to around 0.85, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.
