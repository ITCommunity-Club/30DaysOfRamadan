 ##### ” وَإِذَا سَأَلَكَ عِبَادِى عَنِّى فَإِنِّى قَرِيبٌ ۖ أُجِيب دَعْوَةَ ٱلدَّاعِ إِذَا دَعَانِ ۖ فَلْيَسْتَجِيبُوا لِى وَلْيُؤْمِنُوا بِى لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْشُدُونَ 
 ##### “ And when My servants ask you regarding Me [they should know that], I am near and I answer the prayer of the one who prays when they pray to me, therefore, they should respond to Me and have faith in Me, in order that they may be led aright.

## Todays challenge description [ Who is Taller ?! ] :


Wafa and Nesrine were having an argument about which of them is taller than the other. Racha got irritated by the argument, and decided to settle the matter once and for all.

Racha measured the heights of Wafa and Nesrine, and got to know that Wafa's height is X centimeters and Nesrine's height is Y centimeters. Help Racha decide who is taller.

It is guaranteed that X≠Y

### Input Format

   
    The first line of input will contain an integer T — the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
    The first and only line of each test case contains two integers X and Y, as described in the problem statement.




### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line A if Wafa is taller than Nesrine, else output B. The output is case insensitive, i.e, both A and a will be accepted as correct answers when Wafa is taller.

### Constraints

            1≤T≤1000
            100≤Y,X≤200
            X≠Y

           

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2 |B|
|150 160|A|
|160 150| |




### Explanation:

 - **Test case 1**: In this case, 150<160 so Nesrine is taller than Wafa.

 - **Test case 2**:  In this case, 160>150 so Wafa is taller than Nesrine.
