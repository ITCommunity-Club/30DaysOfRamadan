##### ” التَّحِيَّاتُ للهِ، وَالصَّلَوَاتُ، وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، السَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَى عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ. أّشَْدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّداً عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ

##### “ All greetings of humility are for Allah, and all prayers and goodness. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah. I bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger. ”

## Todays challenge description [  NWAYS ] :

John is playing a game with his friends. The game's rules are as follows: There is deck of N cards from which each person is dealt a hand of K cards. Each card has an integer value representing its strength. A hand's strength is determined by the value of the highest card in the hand. The person with the strongest hand wins the round. Bets are placed before each player reveals the strength of their hand.
John needs your help to decide when to bet. He decides he wants to bet when the strength of his hand is higher than the average hand strength. Hence John wants to calculate the average strength of ALL possible sets of hands. John is very good at division, but he needs your help in calculating the sum of the strengths of all possible hands.

### Problem

You are given an array a with N ≤ 10 000 different integer numbers and a number, K, where 1 ≤ K ≤ N. For all possible subsets of a of size K find the sum of their maximal elements modulo 1 000 000 007.

### Input Format

    The first line contains the number of test cases T, where 1 ≤ T ≤ 25
    Each case begins with a line containing integers N and K. The next line contains N space-separated numbers 0 ≤ a [i] ≤ 2 000 000 000, which describe the array a.

### Output Format

For each test case, print a single integer representing the answer of that test case.

### Constraints

Subtask #1: 10 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 1000
Subtask #2: 10 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 20, 1 ≤ N ,K ≤ 106
Subtask #3: 80 points
◦ 1 ≤ T ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ N,K ≤ 106

Sample 1:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 2     | 8      |
| 2 2   | 236    |
| 4 5   |        |

### Explanation:

- **Test case 1**:For the first sample case,

        ways[(0,1)->(2,1)]= 1

        ways[(0,2)->(2,2)]= 1

        ways[(0,1)->(2,2)]= 3

        ways[(0,2)->(2,1)]= 3

### ADVICE 💖

Google and ChatGPT can be your so called "best friends" but it won't get you anywhere <3 Ctrl+C Ctrl+V are for the weakest of us all ;)
